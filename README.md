# Timeout Project Phase 2

This is part of my App Academy Open projects. In this project, I am practicing dealing with asynchronous functions like `setTimeout` and `setInterval`. The objective is to implement the functions in each file of the `/problems` directory. Mocha specs are provided to test this work.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   cd into the project directory
2. **npm install to install any dependencies**
3. **npm test to run the test cases**
